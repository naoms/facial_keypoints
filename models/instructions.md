Our models were too heavy to load on the Github repository. However, this is what you can do : 
- For the base model with good inference performance, we recommend downloading Balraj98's best model from the kaggle competition (scroll to the end of the page) : 
[Data Augmentation for Facial Keypoint Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/balraj98/data-augmentation-for-facial-keypoint-detection)
- For the Mobilenet model, run the Facial_keypoints.ipynb notebook and train the MobileNet architecture on 80 epochs.
