# Facial_keypoints detection and filter application


In this repository, we implement end-to-end face to face detection and filter application. 
Filters are applied with growing difficulty : from static webcam images and screenshots to videos, both online and offline. 
We successfully implemented this project thanks to two key references : 

[Balraj98's winning solution for the facial keypoint Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/balraj98/data-augmentation-for-facial-keypoint-detection).   
[Rohit Agrawal's work on filter application](https://www.codementor.io/@rohitagrawalofficialmail/how-and-why-i-built-snapchat-filter-system-x5p95x8i0 ).
